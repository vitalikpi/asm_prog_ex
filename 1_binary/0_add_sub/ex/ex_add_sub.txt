Binary addition and subtraction exercises
-----------------------------------------

If you have no previous experience in the binary base, it is crucial that you
solve all the exercises here. Make sure to solve everything before you move on
with the course.

Anything marked with *Bonus* is not required for you to understand the following
material, however It will probably make you smarter.


0.  Addition. Solve the following. Write the solutions in base 2.
    Use a pen and a paper.
    Note: {100}_2 means 100 in base 2.

  0.0   {100}_2 + {1}_2 = 101
  
  100
  001
  ---
  101
  
  0.1   {1111}_2 + {1}_2 = ?
  
  1111
  0001
  ----
 10000

  0.2   {1001110}_2 + {111011}_2 = ?
  
  1001110
  0111011
  -------
 10001001
 

  0.3   {1101}_2 + {1101}_2 = ?
  
  1101
  1101
  ----
 11010

  0.4   {1101}_2 + {1101}_2 + {1101}_2 + {1101}_2 = ?
  
  1101    11010
 +1101   +11010
  ----   ------
 11010   110100

  0.5   Bonus: How much is {8}_10 * {1101}_2 ? (in base 2)
        Note: * means multiplication.

1. Subtraction. Solve the following. Use a pen and a paper:
  
  1.0 {100}_2 - {1}_2 = ?

  1.1 {11000}_2 - {11}_2 = ?

  1.2 {11001101}_2 - {1011}_2 = ?

  1.3 {1000000}_2 - {111011}_2 = ?

  1.4 {10101}_2 - {1010}_2 = ?

  1.5 {1000}_2 - {100}_2 = ?

  1.6 {1100}_2 - {110}_2 = ?  (Bonus: Could you guess it?)


Happy thinking :)
